c) Use the methods developed in parts (a) and (b) to write a method displayDigits that receives an integer between 1 and 99999 and displays it as a sequence of digits, separating each pair of digits by two spaces. For example, the integer 4562 should appear as
4562
Incorporate the methods into an application that inputs an integer and calls display-
Digits by passing the method the integer entered. Display the results.


(Sales Commissions) Use a one-dimensional array to solve the following problem: A com- pany pays its salespeople on a commission basis. The salespeople receive $200 per week plus 9% of their gross sales for that week. For example, a salesperson who grosses $5,000 in sales in a week re- ceives $200 plus 9% of $5,000, or a total of $650. Write an application (using an array of counters) that determines how many of the salespeople earned salaries in each of the following ranges (assume that each salesperson’s salary is truncated to an integer amount):
a) $200–299
b) $300–399
c) $400–499
d) $500–599
e) $600–699
f) $700–799
g) $800–899
h) $900–999
i) $1,000 and over
Summarize the results in tabular format.
